# OOP-Project

This program is based on the Oracle Academy project called "OracleProduction". [Hyperlind pdf]
The purpose of this exercise was to understand the Object Oriented Paradigm and to practice different types of testing methods of a program.
As of now, the current state of the program will create a directory path within the local (C:) drive and initialize a textfile called “TestResult.txt”.  Given the Scenario, this text file will hold a report for Oracles production line and employees that were involved with a product.
Every product should be given a name, serial number, and the date manufactured on.
Products can hold different properties depending on its form. For example, an audio player is different from a movie player.
Employees must enter their department number and their full name into the program to be recorded in the line.

## Build With 
* [IntelliJ IDEA 2018.2.2](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

## Future Plans
